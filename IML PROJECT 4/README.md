# Reinforcement Learning
This project aims at implementing a machine learning paradigm called Reinforcement Learning. We build an agent that navigates the classic 5x5 grid world environment and learns an optimal policy through Q Learning allowing the agent to reach the goal in minimum steps. We create an environment that is compatible with OpenAI Gym library and train the agent by finding a policy which is used by the agent to make decisions thereby maximizing the rewards.</br>
