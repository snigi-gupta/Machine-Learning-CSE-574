# Neural Network Implementation (from scratch)
A Neural Network algorithm which emulates the human brain can classify an image and segregate it into one of the given classes. This is a key algorithm in solving machine learning problems. We use the concept of a connected graph with input and output neurons and weighted edges to classify Fashion MNIST data. Furthermore, we use the concept of Multi
layer and Convolution neural network to solve the same problem using open source neural network library Keras.<br/>
