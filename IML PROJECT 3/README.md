# Unsupervised Learning - Fashion MNIST dataset
This project aims at implementing unsupervised learning over Fashion MNIST data set. We use k-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model algorithms to implement unsupervised learning to draw inferences from the data set consisting of input data without labelled responses. A decent accuracy for the model is achieved by creating a compressed representation of the data using autoencoders.</br>
